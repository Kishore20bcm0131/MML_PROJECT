# FLPDB
Frustruated Lewis Pair Database (FLPDB)

FLPs are a burgeoning field in chemistry with novel FLPs and surprising new reactions continually being discovered. 
However, experimentally examining each FLP's activity toward all possible small molecules (SMs) is impractical due to time constraints and potential dangers from toxic, flammable,
or explosive SMs. Here, we developed the first open-access Frustrated Lewis pairs Database (FLPDB) with DFT optimized atomic structures, and computed binding free energies and 
electronic properties data for each FLP toward SMs, including H2, CO2, H2O, H2CO, HCOOH, CH3OH, via high-throughput computational screening.
